# Benchmark denoising strategies on functional connectomes generated from fMRIPrep outputs

The project is a continuation of [`load_confounds`](https://github.com/SIMEXP/load_confounds). 
The aim is to evaluate the impact of denoising strategy on functional connectivity data, using output processed by fMRIPrep LTS.
