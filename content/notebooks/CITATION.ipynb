    "The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied)\n",

    "the transforms to correct for head-motion.\n",
    "These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as *preprocessed\n",
    "BOLD in original space*, or just *preprocessed BOLD*.\n",
    "The BOLD time-series were resampled into several standard spaces,\n",

    "This mask is obtained by dilating a GM mask extracted from the FreeSurfer's *aseg* segmentation, and it ensures components are not extracted\n",
    "from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM.\n",
    "Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by\n",
    "thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).\n",
    "Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.\n",
    "For each CompCor decomposition, the *k* components with the largest singular\n",
    "values are retained, such that the retained components' time series are\n",
    "sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF,\n",
    "WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from\n",
