    "because area under the same label can be networks with disjointed regions.\n",
    "We present the labels with the original number of parcel,\n",
    "and denote the number of extracted ROI in brackets.\n",
    "Gordon and Schaefer atlas both comes with parcels as isolated ROI hence were applied as it is in the extraction.\n",
    "Schaefer 1000 parcels atlas was excluded as some regions would be dropped after resampling.\n",

    "## Confound regression strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Confound variables were retrieved using API\n",
    "`nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds` (simplified as `load_confounds`),\n",
    "the basic API that retrieves different classes of confound regressor,\n",
    "and `nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds_strategy`(simplified as `load_confounds_strategy`),\n",
    "a higher level wrapper to implement common strategies from the denoising literature.\n",
    "The current section describes the logic behind the design of API.\n",
    "For documentation of the actual function, please see the latest version of `nilearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic noise components\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable easy confound variables loading from fMRIPrep outputs,\n",
    "`load_confounds` provides an interface that groups subsets of confound variables into noise components and their parameters.\n",
    "It is possible to fine-tune a subset of noise components and their parameters through this function.\n",
    "The implementation will only support fMRIPrep functional derivative directory from the 1.2.x series. The compcor noise component requires 1.4.x series or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Explain the logic of nilearn API mirror the intro -->\n",
    "Two types of regressors are always loaded with no additional parameters for user customisation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `high_pass`: discrete cosines transformation basis regressors to handle low-frequency signal drifts.\n",
    "- `non_steady_state` denotes volumes collected before the fMRI scanner has reached a stable state.\n",
    "\n",
    "`motion`, `wm_csf`, and `global_signal` shares similar expansion options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `motion`: head motion estimates translation/rotation (6 parameters).\n",
    "- `wm_csf`: average signal extracted from masks of white matter and cerebrospinal fluids (2 parameters).\n",
    "- `global_signal`: average signal extracted from brain mask (1 parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "For these three parameters above, user can select from the following four options:\n",
    "- `basic`: just the original signal (n parameter)\n",
    "- `power2`: original signal and quadratic term (2 * n parameters)\n",
    "- `derivatives`: original signal and temporal derivative (2 * n parameters)\n",
    "- `full`:  original signal + temporal derivatives + quadratic terms + quadratic terms temporal derivatives (4 * n parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`scrub` generates mask to exclude volumes with excessive motion {cite:p}`power_scrubbing_2012`.\n",
    "Two types of parameters can be used to determined volumes to be excluded.\n",
    "- `fd_threshold`: set the head motion cut-off value determined by framewise displacement approach {cite:p}`power_scrubbing_2012`.\n",
    "- `std_dvars_threshold`: set the head motion cut-off value determined by the standard deviation of root mean square approach {cite:p}`power_scrubbing_2012,jenkinson_2002`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CompCor {cite:p}`behzadi_compcor_2007` approach has two associated parameters\n",
    "- `compcor` allows users to select components generated by the temporal approach,\n",
    "    or the anatomical approach with specific details for the mask used in noise signal extraction.\n",
    "- `n_compcor` retrieves the number of principle components to retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ICA-based approach, fMRIPrep implemented ICA-AROMA {cite:p}`aroma`.\n",
    "User must manually enable ICA-AROMA with flag `--use-aroma` when using fMRIPrep.\n",
    "The parameter `ica_aroma` allows two approaches:\n",
    "1. Use fMRIPrep output with suffix `desc-smoothAROMAnonaggr_bold.nii.gz`.\n",
    "2. Use noise independent components only. Must be used with output with suffix `desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-defined strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "`load_confounds_strategy` provides an interface to select confounds based on past literature with limited parameters for user customisation:\n",
    "`simple` {cite:p}`fox_pnas_2005` (motion parameters, and tissue signal),\n",
    "`scrubbing` {cite:p}`power_scrubbing_2012`(volume censoring, motion parameters, and tissue signal),\n",
    "`compcor` {cite:p}`behzadi_compcor_2007`(anatomical compcor and motion parameters),\n",
    "and `aroma` {cite:p}`aroma`(ICA-AROMA based denoising, and tissue signal).\n",
    "All strategies but `compcor` provides an option to add global signal to the confound regressors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examined strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluated common confound regression strategies that are possible through fMRIPrep generated confound regressors.\n",
    "Subjects with high motion, indicated by less than 80% of remaining volumes after scrubbing with a 0.5 mm threshold, were excluded from all analysis.\n",
    "The connectome generated from high-pass filtered time series were served as a comparison baseline.\n",
    "Confound variables were accessed using API `load_confounds_strategy`.\n",
    "The detailed 11 strategies and a full breakdown of parameters used under the hood is presented in {numref}`table-strategies`.\n",

    "Motion related metrics are centred around framewise displacement.\n",
    "Framewise displacement (FD) indexes the movement of the head from one volume to the next.\n",
    "The movement includes the transitions on the three axes ($x$, $y$, $z$) and the respective rotation ($\\alpha$, $\\beta_t$, $\\gamma$).\n",

    "we first calculate the Euclidean distance between the centers of mass of ecah pair of parcels {cite:p}`power_scrubbing_2012`.\n",
    "We then correlated the distance separating each pair of parcels and the associated QC-FC correlation of the edge connecting those parcels.\n",
