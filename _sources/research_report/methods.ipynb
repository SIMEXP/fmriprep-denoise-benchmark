    "a higher level wrapper to implement common strategies from the denoising literature.\n",
    "The current section describes the logic behind the design of API.\n",

    "\n",
    "To enable easy confound variables loading from fMRIPrep outputs,\n",
    "`load_confounds` provides an interface that groups subsets of confound variables into noise components and their parameters.\n",
    "It is possible to fine-tune a subset of noise components and their parameters through this function.\n",

    "For these three parameters above, user can select from the following four options:\n",
    "- `basic`: just the original signal (n parameter)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Loss in temporal degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "The common analysis and denoising methods are based on linear reagression.\n",
    "Using more nuisance regressors can capture additional sources of noise-related variance in the data and thus improve denoising.\n",
    "However, this comes at the expense of a loss of temporal degrees of freedom for statistical inference in further analysis.\n",
    "This is an important point to consider along side the denoising performance.\n",
    "There are two factors constraining the degrees of freedom in the signal: \n",
    "number of volumes in a scan and number of nuisance regressors used during denoising. \n",
    "We calculate the number of regressors used for each strategy.\n",
    "For scrubbing-based strategy we further calculate the proportion of volume loss to number of volumes in a scan.\n",

    "\n",
    "To determine the residual distance-dependence of subject movement,\n",
    "we first calculate the Euclidean distance between the centers of mass of ecah pair of parcels {cite:p}`power_scrubbing_2012`.\n",
    "We then correlated the distance separating each pair of parcels and the associated QC-FC correlation of the edge connecting those parcels.\n",
    "Closer parcels generally exhibiting greater impact of motion on connectivity.\n",
    "We expect to see a general trend of negative correlation to no correlation after confound regression.\n",

    "### Network modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "Confound regressors has the potential to remove real signal in addition to motion-related noise.\n",
