# Overview

The project is a continuation of [`load_confounds`](https://github.com/SIMEXP/load_confounds). 
The aim is to evaluate the impact of denoising strategy on functional connectivity data, using output processed by fMRIPrep LTS.

The main tool is now part of 
[`nilearn`](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/generated/nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds.html#nilearn.interfaces.fmriprep.load_confounds).

The preliminary results will be presented at OHBM 2022 as a poster. 
Please find poster number `WTh570`.
