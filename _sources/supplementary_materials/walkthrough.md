#  Code documentation

I (HTW) aims to provide some documentation for people who would like to rebuild 
all material of this book.
The code walk through is separated into two parts.
For those who wish to generate all the time series, connectomes, and metric, 
but not the full book, please see [Setup of this project](setup.md).
If you only want to rebuild the content of the book for the review process, 
or help me edit the manuscript, please see [Rebuild the book](build_book.md).
