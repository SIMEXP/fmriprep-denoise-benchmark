    "In the following section, the number of discrete cosine-basis regressors will be denoted as $c$. \n",
    "Depending on the length of the scan, the number of discrete cosine-basis regressors can differ ($c_{ds000228}=4$, $c_{ds000030}=3$). \n",
    "The `simple` and `scrubbing`-based strategies are the strategy with a fixed number of degrees of freedom loss.\n",
    "`compcor` and `aroma`-based strategies show variability depending on the number of noise components detected.\n",
    "In theory, `compcor6` should also report a fixed number of degrees of freedom loss.\n",
    "However, fMRIPrep outputs the compcor components based on the 50% variance cut-off.\n",
    "For some subjects the number of components could be lower than 6, hence the variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In {cite:t}`ciric_benchmarking_2017`, the equivalent `aroma` and `aroma+gsr` strategies were reported with \n",
    "a lower magnitude of loss in temporal degrees of freedom than `scrubbing` or `simple` strategies.\n",
