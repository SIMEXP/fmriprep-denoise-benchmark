# Introductions

Selecting an optimal denoising strategy is a key issue when processing fMRI data. 
The popular software fMRIPrep {cite:p}`esteban_fmriprep_2020` aims to standardize fMRI preprocessing, 
but users are still offered a wide range of confound regressors to choose from to denoise data. 
Without a good understanding of the literature or the fMRIPrep documentation, 
users can select suboptimal strategies. 
Current work aims to provide a useful reference for fMRIPrep users by systematically evaluating the impact of different confound regression strategies, 
and by contrasting the results with past literature based on alternative preprocessing software.
