# Benchmark denoising strategies on fMRIPrep 

The project is a continuation of [load_confounds](https://github.com/SIMEXP/load_confounds).
The aim is to evaluate the impact of denoising strategy on functional connectivity data, using output processed by fMRIPrep LTS.

## Dataset structure

- All inputs (i.e. building blocks from other sources) are located in
  `inputs/`.
- All custom code is located in `code/`.
